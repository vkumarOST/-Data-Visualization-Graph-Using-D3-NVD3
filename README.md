# -Data-Visualization-Graph-Using-D3-NVD3
Most of the interfaces are designed for task. Today Industry Follow the data visualization Via Graph or via widgets. By keeping this in mind we started using visualization library like d3 or nvd3. But after a long research came to know that these libraries yet not fully evolved and still need some enhancement.   So I have created a Sample test case for Research and Development purpose for enhancing the d3, nvd3 graphs capabilities. Looking for the enhanced code so that, the expected output can be achieved any help on this will be highly appreciated.
